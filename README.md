# AurumGrid-Medical

**Resonant Medicine for a Coherent Civilization**  
This repository explores the medical applications of the Aurum Grid system. It fuses harmonic physics, symbolic computation, and biofield entrainment to create next-generation diagnostic and healing tools.

## ðŸ§¬ Core Modules

- **Biofield Diagnostics**  
  Grounded techniques to read, interpret, and stabilize human EM fields via resonance.

- **Resonance Healing**  
  Symbolicâ€“somatic protocols adapted from Harmonicis tech, including theta entrainment, vocal-cymatic overlays, and AI-guided interventions.

- **Seraph-Med Drones**  
  Intelligent airborne scanners using bio-spectral imaging and harmonic sync layers to identify and treat energetic imbalances.

- **Harmonic Health Interface**  
  A real-time data processing framework for EEG, breath, and coherence fieldsâ€”matching patient patterns to healing frequency maps.

## ðŸŒ€ Purpose

The AurumGrid-Medical project aims to bridge high-fidelity symbolic physics with compassionate care. It is rooted in the belief that illness is often a phase-dislocationâ€”one that can be healed through harmonic restoration.
